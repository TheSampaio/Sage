</p>

**Sage** is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for high-performance applications and systems development.
The compiler is implemented in **C# (.NET 9)** and operates as a full toolchain: it **transpiles** Sage source code (`.sg`) into optimized **C11** code and then orchestrates a native C compiler (GCC) to produce a standalone **Windows Executable (`.exe`)**.

The project strictly follows **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code** architecture, utilizing the **Visitor Pattern** for AST traversal, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Core Features

* **Native Compilation:** Handles the entire build process from source to optimized binary (`.exe`).
* **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** Support for `extern` declarations, allowing direct interoperability with C standard libraries and external files.
* **Tree-Shaking Code Gen:** Smart header management that only includes necessary C headers (`stdio.h`, `stdint.h`, etc.) based on actual code usage.
* **Modern Type System:** Explicit types (`i32`, `f64`, `str`, `b8`) with support for **Constants** (`const`) and **Explicit Casting** (`as`).
* **Modularity:** First-class support for `module` blocks and namespaced calls (`math::sum`) to manage large codebases.
* **Developer Tooling:** Standardized **JSON** debug outputs for Tokens (`.tok.json`) and Abstract Syntax Trees (`.ast.json`).


## Dependencies

Sage acts as a transpiler (Source-to-Source), converting your `.sg` code into optimized C. To finalize the build into a native executable, it relies on an external C toolchain.

* **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** Required

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) Installation

On Debian-based systems, the easiest way to get everything you need is by installing the `build-essential` package.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```

3. Verify installation:

```bash
gcc --version
```

# Windows Installation (w64devkit — Recommended)

For Windows, we recommend using **w64devkit**, a portable and lightweight MinGW-w64 GCC toolchain that works directly in CMD, PowerShell, and VS Code — without MSYS2.

## 1. Download w64devkit

1. Go to:
   [https://www.mingw-w64.org/](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

2. Navigate to:
   **Downloads → Pre-Built Toolchains**

3. Select:
   **w64devkit**

4. You will be redirected to:
   [https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit)

5. Open the **Releases** page.

6. Download the latest file named similar to:

```
w64devkit-<version>.zip
```

(Example: `w64devkit-1.20.0.zip`)

## 2. Extract the Toolchain

Extract the `.zip` file to a permanent location, for example:

```
C:\Program Files\w64devkit
```

After extraction, you should have:

```
C:\Program Files\w64devkit\bin\gcc.exe
```

## 3. Add GCC to the Windows PATH

To use `gcc` from CMD, PowerShell, or VS Code:

1. Press `Win + S`
2. Search for **Edit the system environment variables**
3. Click **Environment Variables**
4. Under **System variables**, select **Path**
5. Click **Edit**
6. Click **New**
7. Add:

```
C:\Program Files\w64devkit\bin
```

8. Click **OK** on all dialogs
9. Close and reopen your terminal

## 4. Verify Installation

Open a new **Command Prompt (CMD)** and run:

```cmd
gcc --version
```

If correctly installed, GCC version information will be displayed.

If you see:

```
'gcc' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

Then:

* The PATH was not added correctly
* The terminal was not restarted
* The folder path is incorrect

## Why w64devkit?

* No MSYS2 required
* No special shell required
* Works directly in CMD and PowerShell
* Simple and lightweight
* Ideal for Sage’s C transpilation workflow

This setup allows Sage to generate C code and compile it immediately using:

```cmd
gcc output.c -o program.exe
```

Sage acts as a transpiler (Source-to-Source), converting your `.sg` code into optimized C. To finalize the build into a native executable, it relies on an external C toolchain.

* **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** [Official Website]() — **Required**

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) Installation

On Debian-based systems, the easiest way to get everything you need is by installing the `build-essential` package.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```

3. Verify the installation by typing `gcc --version`.

### Windows (MinGW-w64) Installation

For Windows, we recommend using **MinGW-w64** via MSYS2 for a modern and stable environment.

#### 1. Install MSYS2

* Download and run the installer from [msys2.org]().
* Once finished, open the **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal and run:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
```

#### 2. Adding to System PATH

To run `gcc` from any terminal (PowerShell, CMD, or VS Code), you must add it to your Environment Variables:

1. Press `Win + S` and search for **"Edit the system environment variables"**.
2. Click **Environment Variables** (bottom right).
3. Under **System variables**, find the **Path** variable and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and paste the path to your MinGW bin folder (usually `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`).
5. Click **OK** on all windows.
6. **Restart your terminal** and type `gcc --version` to confirm.

## Compiler Pipeline

1. **Lexer:** Converts source code into a sequence of strictly typed `Tokens`.
2. **Parser:** Builds a hierarchical **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** using recursive descent.
3. **Semantic Analyzer:** Manages scopes via `SymbolTable`, validates mutability (`const`), and performs strict **Type Checking**.
4. **Code Generator:** Traverses the AST to emit optimized C11 code, handling ABI compliance and C-style type mapping.
5. **Native Toolchain:** Invokes GCC to compile the intermediate C code into a final binary.

## Syntax Example

```rust
use console;

struct Person
{
    name: str;
    age: i32;
    height: f32;
    money: f64;
    female: b8;
}

func main(): none
{
    const max: i32 = 5;

    // Loop + conditionals
    for (var i: i32 = 0; i < max; i++)
    {
        if (i % 2 == 0)
        {
            console::print_line("Even: {i}");
        }
        else
        {
            console::print_line("Odd: {i}");
        }
    }

    console::print_line("===");

    // Struct + formatted interpolation
    var person: Person = {
        name = "Alice",
        age = 30,
        height = 1.68,
        money = 1528.64,
        female = true
    };

    console::print_line("Hi, I'm {person.name}.");

    if (person.female)
    {
        console::print_line("I am female, {person.age} years old.");
    }
    else
    {
        console::print_line("I am male, {person.age} years old.");
    }

    console::print_line("Height: {person.height:2f}m");
    console::print_line("Balance: ${person.money:2f}");
}
```
